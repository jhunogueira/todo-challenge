Desafio - conceitos do React Native. IGNITE, Rocketseat

This react native app is a to do list. It was a nice project to make for a good first app to learn React Native.
You can add toDo's at your list, edit the toDo and delete them and has a count of toDo's at the header.

To see how this project works you must clone this repository, run yarn start or npm start and run on your preferible SDK (yarn ios or yarn android).
